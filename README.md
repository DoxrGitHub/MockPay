# MockPay Pay
Crack extensions that use ExtPay:

1. Dump the extension, use https://robwu.nl/crxviewer/
2. Replace the ExtPay.js file with the one found in this repo
3. Make sure dev mode on chrome://extensions is on and load the directory with the extension as unpacked
4. The extension should immediately believe you're a paid user

**You can also use this as a mock ExtPay thing if you are developing the extension and want it to believe you're paid while developing...**
